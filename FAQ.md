Q: Why LR generated by `cv2.resize` is different from the one provided in [SelfExSR](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/SelfExSR) ? 

A: 
SelfExSR generated LR and bicubic SR using matlab `imresize` function, which is slightly different from `cv2.resize`.
Specifically, `imresize` use anti-aliasing by default, which is missing in `cv2.resize`.
